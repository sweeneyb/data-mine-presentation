# Themes
* Design your career
* 
* Deliver outcomes, not code

Note:
* Careers don't have to be fluid
* median tenure is 16-24 months

* Code leverages us by encoding our decisions, lowering latency, and increasing throughput. Code is not special, any system that can do that is valuable.

| See how uniqely each industry scores competitors| Not a wide support matrix |
| How to manage constrained talent supply | working with constrained talent   |

Note:
* Platforms and DX is hugely important when working with BAs converted to devs
* Industries were convinced they could convert BAs to devs in 2018.
* The value was encoding the decisions. Anyone can learn to program
    * DSLs, low-code, Appian/Guidewire, well before LLMs
